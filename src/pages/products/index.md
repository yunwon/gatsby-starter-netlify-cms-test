      - title: Benefits of Wool
        description:
          - subDescription: >-
              Wool is unique in its insulation properties and brings its proven
              characteristics into our residential and business environments.
              Wool is excellent in providing healthy, warm, dry and comfortable
              living environments. Wool has been proven through its years of use
              in fabrics, apparel, bedding and carpets. It is a natural fibre
              used universally for personal comfort and warmth.
            subTitle: WOOL IS A NATURAL CHOICE
          - subDescription: >-
              Wool is the only insulation material that is not inert. Wool fibre
              breathes and reacts to climatic change which effectively allows
              your home and office to breathe. Wool is an extremely effective
              insulator when moisture is present within the environment. This is
              a continual occurrence due to the ever changing level of humidity
              within the atmosphere. Insulation products without absorption
              ability can be adversely effected by humidity. The presence of
              moisture is evidenced by water, condensation, mould and mildew
              within buildings.
            subTitle: 'WOOL BREATHES, WOOL IS NOT INERT'
          - subDescription: >-
              This means that wool can absorb moisture without becoming wet to
              touch. Wools natural insulation ability is not affected by
              moisture because of its built in natural crimp. As the fibres
              naturally repel each other, an amount of air is retained which
              provides an insulation effect. The fibre has the capability of
              absorbing up to 30% of its own weight in moisture, before it
              becomes wet to touch. Wool in essence, provides a form of natural
              air-conditioning!
            subTitle: WOOL IS A HYGROSCOPIC INSULATOR
          - subDescription: >-
              Warm and dry environments are essential in providing healthy
              living conditions. Wool has a natural ability to achieve this by
              absorbing and desorbing moisture. Through this characteristic,
              benefits can be obtained by sufferers of a wide range of health
              conditions such as asthmatic and other respiratory ailments.
              Unlike some finer micron synthetic materials, the body does not
              absorb wool fibre through inhalation. Wool used for insulation is
              on average in the 25 – 40 micron range. Synthetic materials used
              in other forms of insulation products can be as low as 6 micron.
              Wool is a natural protein substance. The protein from wool fibre
              is currently being used in the cosmetic and pharmaceutical
              industries. This would obviously not occur if there was an element
              of risk or harmful effect.
            subTitle: WOOL IS HEALTHY
          - subDescription: >-
              Wool being a natural fibre contains no irritants, is non toxic and
              absolutely safe to handle. The fibre contains no dangerous dust
              and does not require breathing protection. No protective gloves or
              clothing are required in handling or installing.
            subTitle: WOOL IS NON ALLERGIC AND SAFE TO HANDLE
          - subDescription: >-
              Wool based products reduce the risk to health and environment as a
              result of its ability to absorb gases and fumes such as
              formaldehydes and dioxides that are present in construction and
              finishing materials associated with building. Wool can absorb many
              times more formaldahyde than is found in the average home.
            subTitle: WOOL ABSORBS GASES & FUMES
          - subDescription: >-
              Natural wool has very low conductivity which means that it is very
              difficult for heat to transfer through the fibre. Experience shows
              that wool does not settle or compact over time as some synthetic
              products do, thereby effecting thermal effectiveness.
            subTitle: WOOL IS VERY LOW IN CONDUCTIVITY
          - subDescription: >-
              Wool is naturally fire resistant and will not burn but melt away
              from its ignition source and extinguish. Wool has a higher fire
              resistance than cellulose and cellular plastic insulation. Wool
              used in insulation has been tested disclosing an ignitability and
              spread of flame index of zero and smoke developed index of 5.
            subTitle: WOOL IS FIRE RESISTANT
          - subDescription: >-
              We live in a country proud of its ecological approach towards
              environmental management. Wool is a natural product that emits no
              harmful chemicals that pollute our atmosphere, soil or water ways.
              Wool is safe to our environment and is a renewable resource.

      - title: What is EarthWool made of?
        description:
          - subDescription: >-
              EarthWool is made using recycled glass bottles (up to 80% recycled
              content), sand and a revolutionary sustainable binder making it
              the best choice for environmentally conscious customers.
      - title: Why is EarthWool different than other forms of insulation?
        description:
          - subDescription: >-
              Knauf Insulation’s new EarthWool products don’t look or feel like
              any insulation you’ve ever experienced, that’s because the natural
              brown colour represents a level of sustainability and ease of
              handling never before achieved in New Zealand. The colour and
              ‘super soft’ feel comes from a revolutionary sustainable binder
              which does not contain the oil based chemicals, added formaldehyde
              or artificial colours commonly used in other insulation.
      - title: Why is EarthWool brown?
        description:
          - subDescription: >-
              The distinctive brown colour of EarthWool® results from ECOSE®
              Technology. This natural binding process leads to a natural shade
              of earthy brown—free from dye or colorants. This is a result of
              five years of intensive research and development as part of our
              commitment to being at the forefront of sustainability. In some
              cases if EarthWool is exposed to UV radiation it may result in a
              white bleaching effect, however product performance is not
              diminished.
