          - subDescription: >-
              Polyester insulation products are made from 100% polyester fibre,
              bonded using heat instead of traditional chemical binders.
              Polyester is naturally resistant to fire, moisture, vermin,
              insects, mould and bacteria, eliminating the need for any chemical
              additives. Our polyester insulation materials are non-toxic,
              non-irritating, non-allergenic and safe for anyone coming into
              contact with them. And that means no nasty itching and scratching
              and no ongoing health concerns for building occupiers.
      - title: Eco-friendly manufacture and recycling practices
        description:
          - subDescription: >-
              Our Polyester products are committed to Quality and Environmental
              best practice through our ISO 9001 and ISO 14001 certified Quality
              and Environmental Management Systems. Our Polyester insulation
              products are made from only polyester fibres so they remain fully
              recyclable at the end of their lives. Polyester products are
              manufactured under our Zero Waste policy and using a low-energy
              production process, putting them among the most
              environmentally-friendly insulation solutions on the market.

      - title: What is EarthWool made of?
        description:
          - subDescription: >-
              EarthWool is made using recycled glass bottles (up to 80% recycled
              content), sand and a revolutionary sustainable binder making it
              the best choice for environmentally conscious customers.
      - title: Why is EarthWool different than other forms of insulation?
        description:
          - subDescription: >-
              Knauf Insulation’s new EarthWool products don’t look or feel like
              any insulation you’ve ever experienced, that’s because the natural
              brown colour represents a level of sustainability and ease of
              handling never before achieved in New Zealand. The colour and
              ‘super soft’ feel comes from a revolutionary sustainable binder
              which does not contain the oil based chemicals, added formaldehyde
              or artificial colours commonly used in other insulation.
      - title: Why is EarthWool brown?
        description:
          - subDescription: >-
              The distinctive brown colour of EarthWool® results from ECOSE®
              Technology. This natural binding process leads to a natural shade
              of earthy brown—free from dye or colorants. This is a result of
              five years of intensive research and development as part of our
              commitment to being at the forefront of sustainability. In some
              cases if EarthWool is exposed to UV radiation it may result in a
              white bleaching effect, however product performance is not
              diminished.
      - title: Why is EarthWool softer and less itchy than traditional glasswool?
        description:
          - subDescription: >-
              EarthWool® uses a combination of new technologies which make the product more comfortable to handle. Firstly, Knauf Insulation’s proprietary fiberisation process creates longer strands resulting in less ‘ends’ to reduce mechanical irritation. Secondly, Knauf Insulation’s patented ECOSE Technology results in a much softer, less ‘crunchy’ and less dusty insulation product compared to our traditional glasswool products made using formaldehyde. EarthWool is easy to cut
      - title: How does the use of EarthWool affect the air quality in living areas?
        description:
          - subDescription: >-
              With no added formaldehyde, EarthWool is suitable for use in households with allergies. Knauf has recently become the world’s first company to receive the coveted Eurofins Indoor Air Comfort Gold standard. The Gold standard certificate was awarded to Knauf Insulation’s revolutionary new EarthWool products made with ECOSE Technology.
