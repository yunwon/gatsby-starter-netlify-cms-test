  New healthy homes standards for rental properties in New Zealand became law on
  1 July 2019. The standards will play a significant role in maintaining and
  improving the quality of the rental properties. These standards will help
  ensure landlords have healthier, safer properties and lower maintenance costs
  for their investments.
